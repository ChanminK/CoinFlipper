THEME: COINS

NEW IDEA:

SLACK BOT THAT ENABLES GAMBLING YEAHHH

Key features:

First is opt-in(reactions added), then opt into seeing commands(other people playing, others doing /leaderboard, etc. You can just run commnands by just opting into the basic one.) Will ask if they want to opt into commands every day

Commands:
/stopgambling


Reacts to messages and adds emojis:
    Coin - add coin reaction
    Gamble, gambeling - lets go gambeling or smth
    Win, won - heidi happy
    Lose, Lost - orpheous sad

Ai:
Ai debate - try to argue to an ai about how gambeling is morally good
    based on how good it is awards coins
    but since ai reward system takes too long, all requests will be sent to me before giving payour

Game:
Three games you can do:
Flip a coin - Flip a coin, you have to call which side before flipping
Old Maid(joker version) - Each player gets 4 cards, they have to each pick a card from the other's hand and 1 card from each hand is taken away from each turn(not joker though)
Poker - Just regular poker(maybe play using emojis or smth)
typing battle - speec to see how fast each person can type a certain sentence(chosen from a bank of cards)


Battle:
Either pvp or against an ai dealer I need to check salck bot's capabilities
/challenge @username or dealer
    Then do a game
    Then an amount of coins
    Other side has to accept
    Play 
    Winner gets all, loser loses everything
    Double or nothing button appears

Shop:
You can certain power-ups and cosmetics at the store
Streak saver - saves you from losing your gambeling Streak
Game breaker - you can choose to mkake it so that a game doesn't count
Sigma - Don't get your coins reset at the end of the week 
Reactor - The bot will now respond to every message you send and glaze you 

Streak:
Every day you 

Leaderboard:
/leaderboard - posts top 10 with the most coins, displays users relative rank at the bottom and says "You are number #"
Daily refresh - every day at 12:00 AM EST bot posts top 10 with their streak, user can see their own relative score and streak
Every week at Monday 12:00 AM winners are announced, coins reset
Also person with lowest amount of coins announced too

Coins:
/coin to check coin balance
Every day everyone is given 100 coins.
For games, you are allowed to bet more then what you have as long as you have a positive number of coins. If you have a negative number, you cannot play any games

Secret:
The secret coin
Chance for someone to get it (1 in a million odds) Once they do, they get dmd that they got it and they can brag about it if they want
Also there are 3 of these
They don't get wiped from the weekly reset, once you get all three the bot will publically annouce to everyone and the person who has the coins will get 1 million coins

Reach:
More/better art pieces


daily coin flip?

sfx with button press/emote?

Way to urls to open on user end somehow

make it so that it reacts to certain emojis/reactions
